Number streams ("数溪 - ShùXī" in Chinese): experimenting with Elixir / Phoenix
for analysing and streaming billions of numbers using Decorator design pattern.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
